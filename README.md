# SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing Resources

This repository is meant to be the start of a crowd-sourced collection of information, documentation and methods for laboratories that are planning to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes at any scale, in the weeks to come. This is admittedly a pretty limited first draft/collection, but I hope that it will continue to grow as additional protocols, tools, and resources are added.

Please feel free to suggest additions, edits, clarifications, either by posting an issue/commit or by email/twitter. I'll continue to add and mirror useful resources as I come across them.

This may move to a more "official" GitHub location, once I start to build out the content a bit more, but I wanted to get the ball rolling.
